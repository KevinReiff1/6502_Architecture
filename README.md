
# Project Explanation

This project is a virtual 6502 processor emulator written in TypeScript and running on Node.js. This project is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the 6502 microarchitecture and the fundamentals of computer organization and architecture.

## Project Overview

This project emulates a 6502 architecture, which is a well-known microprocessor architecture used in many classic computing systems. It operates on a limited instruction set, providing an educational platform for learning how low-level machine instructions work.

### Key Features

- **6502 Emulation**: Accurately emulates the behavior of the 6502 microprocessor.
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Written entirely in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Runs on server-side JavaScript, making it easily accessible and modifiable.
- **Limited Instruction Set**: Focuses on a subset of the 6502 instruction set to simplify learning and debugging.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **TypeScript**: Install TypeScript globally using npm:
  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsiraM-6502.git
   cd tsiraM-6502
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

4. Start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

After starting the Node.js server, the 6502 emulator will be running and ready to execute programs written in the supported instruction set. You can interact with the emulator through the provided interfaces and modify it as needed to explore different aspects of the 6502 microarchitecture.

## Conclusion

tsiraM-6502 is a powerful educational tool for anyone interested in learning about the inner workings of microprocessors and low-level programming. By emulating the 6502 architecture, this project offers a hands-on experience with one of the most iconic microprocessors in computing history.
